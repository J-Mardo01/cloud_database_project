# Overview - Cloud Database

This is the readMe file for the cloud database software I created to interact with the cloud. This software is able to write, read, update, and delete information in the cloud. 

I wrote this software with the intention of learning more about cloud databases and how to interact with them. I also decided to work on this to sharpen up my javascript knowledge and learn more about the usefulness of that language.

# Cloud Database

For this project, I used MongoDB Atlas, which is a cloud database service provided by MongoDB. The database is named "Clients" and has one collection called "Names". I plan to create more collections and store additional information as I link this database to the mobile app I have been working on.


# Development Environment

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}
To develop this software, I used Node.js (v16.14.0), MongoDB (6.3.0), MongoDB Atlas, and VS Code (1.85.1). I also used any default node modules that are included in the installation of the MongoDB Node.js Driver.


# Useful Websites

{Make a list of websites that you found helpful in this project}
I found these websites helpful as I researched and learned about cloud databases. 

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud-database)
- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/)

# Future Work

In the future, I hope to increase the implementation of this cloud database. I can do this by:

- Designing the API functions to interact with the backend.
- Use express.js to help link the database to my mobile app.
- Add user authentication to add security to the data.
